# My Library
This is a guide for my video game library. The all-important file is 'my_library.js' where you'll find the source code of the functions used.

HOW TO USE:
Refer to 'how-to-use.js'

MUST HAVE:
The 'p5.js' and 'p5.play.js' are necessary for creating sprites and using certain functions, if you are running my code without adding these files, the code will not work. 'index.html' is the main html file where all the JavaScript files are linked.

To see the output of the code I have attached to this repository, refer to https://empthesalamander.github.io/My-Game-Library/
